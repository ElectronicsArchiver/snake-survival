line enemy:
    spawn:
        wrap numberline around rectangle,
        use map(random()) to select a point (StartPoint) and note the side the point is on (StartSide)
        (Direction) is calculated as the angle between (StartPoint) and (arg position)
        use Direction and StartPoint and bounding lines to calculate the exit point (EndPoint)
        use (static Speed) and distance(EndPoint - StartPoint) to calculate (lifespan) for (super())
        (get position()) takes active -- burnout?
update controls (left/right tapping instead of joystick) [?]

JUICE

merge updated globals.js and helper-functions.js with js-engine (and decide units for angles?)
merge updated vector.js with js-engine (and decide units for angles?)
changes made to engine:
    helper-functions.js - helper circle function added, helper map function added
    globals.js - numerous functions now accept vectors as arguments
    vector.js - added inBounds() and inBoundsUnordered(), as well as JSDoc comments, fixed setPolar()
